# LSIIC - Let's See If It Crashes

Here's that weird [Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades](http://h3vr.com) mod I've been working on since late 2017 or so, recently ported to BepInEx. Some older parts of LSIIC have moved to the [CursedDlls](https://github.com/drummerdude2003/CursedDlls.BepinEx/) project.
